# Trees
A tree is a data structure composed of nodes.
- Each tree has a root node
- The root node has zero or more child nodes
- Each child node has zero or more child nodes, and so on. 

## Leaf
A node is called a 'leaf' if it has no children.

## Binary Tree
A binary tree is a tree in which each node has up to two children. 

## Binary Search Tree
A binary search tree is a tree where every nodes left descendents are less than or equal to the current node and every nodes right descendents are greater than or equal to the current node.

All left descendants must be less than the root node and all right descendants must be greater than the root node.

## Balanced vs. Unbalanced

## Complete Binary Trees
A binary tree in which every level of the tree is fully filled, expect perhaps the last level. To the extent that the last level is filled, it is filled left to right. 

## Full Binary Trees
A binary tree in which every node has either zero or children. No nodes have only one child.

## Perfect Binary Trees
A binary tree that is both complete and full. All leaf nodes will be at same level and this level has the maximum number of nodes.
