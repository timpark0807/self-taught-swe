## Introduction
Welcome to my journey.

After receiving a degree in Economics and landing an accounting job, I realized I was unsatisfied with the nature of the work. 
Debits and credits bored me. 
I wanted to solve problems.

As an accountant, you spend everyday with a spreadsheet open so Excel immediately caught my interest did. 
I mastered formulas/techinques such as INDEX/MATCH, SUMIFs, Conditional Formatting, Pivot Tables, and Data Validation. 
I quickly became the Excel wizard in my office.
I was exposed to my first glimpse into programming using Excel VBA to automate a daily task involving copying data from one workbook to another.
I played with VBA for a few months, but never dedicated myself to programming. 
Programming was a tool to get my work done with less headaches.

One day, a new challenge appeared when I wanted to download PDF's from external websites. 
This was outside VBA's capabilities so I sought for another solution. 
Python. 

I convinced IT to install Python on my work computer and began breaking the problem into smaller questions, googling everything I could think of. 
I strugged for nearly 2 days but eventually produced a script that sent GET requests to a website, extracted a specific page, and sent it as an email. 
I scaled this script to 22 revenues deposited on different every days, scheduling automated execution using .BAT files and Windows Task Scheduler. 
Converting a business problem into an idea, and then breaking the idea into tiny portions of code and then piecing it back together as a longer script was incredible.
There was an actual feeling of euphoria when the script finally ran and did what I had intended.

I was hooked.

In that moment, I knew I wanted to be a software engineer.

Now the difficult part is that you don't know what you don't know. And I didn't know much. 
This guide is the result hundreds of questions searched on reddit, youtube, and stackoverflow on self-taught programming.
I began noticing trends in user responses across these platforms on things like best courses, best books, best practices, and important concepts.
I compiled these findings into this repository as I progressed in my software engineering journey. 

Note there are plenty of online guides on how to do so, but creating my own respoitory gave me the ability to track my personal progress.
This repository is designed to guide myself from programming noob to software developer. 
I have listed courses I have personally completed and books that I have read.
