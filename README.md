## Introduction
This project is the result of thousands of Google searches on self-taught programming.
I began noting trends on subjects ranging from best courses and books, to must know concepts and important practices.
I compiled my findings into this repository in order to track personal progress and showcase skillset to potential employers.
All concepts, courses, and books listed in this README have been personally learned/completed/read.
