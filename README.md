## Introduction
This project is the result of thousands of Google searches on self-taught programming.
I began noticing trends on topics ranging from best courses and books, to must know concepts and important practices.
I compiled my findings into this repository in order to track personal progress and showcase skillset to potential employers.
All concepts, courses, and books listed in this README have been personally learned, completed, or read.

## Concepts
- Object Oriented Programming
- Git 
- Debugging
- Testing
- Web Framework (Model/View/Controller)
- Big O
	*A Gentle Introduction to Algorithm Complexity Analysis
	* http://discrete.gr/complexity/

## Data Structures
1. Linear 
    - Arrays
    - Linked Lists
	-> Reverse a Linked List
	-> Linked List Palindrome
	-> Cycle Detection
    - Stacks
	-> Max/Min Stack
	-> Using stacks for DFS
    - Queues

2. Non Linear
    - Heaps
	- Top K elements -> using heapq
    - Trees
	- Searches
	- Minimum depth of Tree
	- Binary tree symmetric
    - Graphs
