From programming noob to software engineer.

## Syllabus
- Introduction
- General Concepts
- Data Structures
- Algorithms
- Courses 
- Books

## Introduction
This guide is the result hundreds of questions searched on reddit, youtube, and stackoverflow on self-taught programming.
I began noticing trends in user responses across these platforms on things like best courses, best books, best practices, and important concepts.
I compiled these findings into this repository as I progressed in my software engineering journey. 

Note there are plenty of online guides on how to do so, but creating my own respoitory gave me the ability to track my personal progress.
This repository is designed to guide myself from programming noob to software developer. 
I have listed courses I have personally completed and books that I have read. 

## Concepts
- [x] Object Oriented Programming
- [x] Git
